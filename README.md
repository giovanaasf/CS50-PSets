Welcome to the repository of my CS50 problem sets! Here you will find a diverse collection of projects and problem sets that I have completed during the CS50 course at Harvard University.

## About CS50

CS50 is Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. It caters to both concentrators and non-concentrators, regardless of prior programming experience. The course emphasizes problem-solving, correctness, design, and style, covering topics such as computational thinking, abstraction, algorithms, data structures, and more.

## Problem Sets

CS50 problem sets are inspired by different fields, including arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences. These problem sets challenge me to think critically and creatively, providing opportunities to apply coding skills to solve real-world problems.

Some of the problem sets I have completed include:

- **Sentimental - Mario:** A program that prints half-pyramids of a specified height using hashes (#).
- **Caesar:** A program that encrypts messages using a user-provided key and the Caesar Cipher technique.
- **Vigenère:** A program that encrypts messages using a keyword and the Vigenère Cipher technique.
- **Recover:** A program that recovers deleted JPEG images from a forensic image file.

## Conclusion

I hope you enjoy exploring my CS50 Projects and Problem Sets repository. Each project and problem set represents a step in my journey to become a proficient programmer!
